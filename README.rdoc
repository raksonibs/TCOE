- angular application for blog. Will base a new post on it.
Basically factory for pages, and pages have the content. It is a smart markdown editor(angular js directive) that allows Kacper to preview what he looks at. Each page is indetifed by its slug, so would be rkacperwrite/#/pages/{page_name} or #/page-name.

That is really it, plus two factor authentication, and being able to edit everything. 

- login action redirects to dashboard path of admin screen
- need to reroute create and all that
