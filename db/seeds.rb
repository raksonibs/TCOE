body: "The Niburski Synthesis

If you want to write a story, you must first learn how to compose ether.

I was 21 when I synthesized the functional group. I didn’t know it. The mixture was colourless, airtight. I saw a few bubbles is all. I was a failed chemist with my mind empty and my mouth agape. Worse yet was that I was also unknowingly a physical embodiment of the chemical compound – my shoulders shrugged like alkyl chains.

Dr. Stover, a pleasant, thoughtful supervisor with smile and explanation for everything, came over and asked what I was creating. I mumbled that a graduate student told me to throw some chemicals into a beaker and watch the reaction for her. He asked what chemicals. I listed a few. He said, “You’re making an ether. It is shared with some of the most important compounds like vitamin E.”

I looked back to the flask. It burped.

He shuffled away and the day swept on with the light blocked by curtains and the lab chilled for sample preservation.  The year did too. I worked and reworked and eventually produced some good work in the lab. I could tell you what, could discuss the nights over a bench with a silicon plate in hand and a distillation running at the same time, could tell you when I mistook butyl lithium for water, could tell you what vitamin E looks like now, but first you would need to learn how to create ether.

For to tell the story, to realize its end, you must understand that in ether is the whole of chemistry. 

*

I haven’t changed much since five years have slapped on by. I still don’t know what I am forming. I am still a failure too, though in this case at teaching. For though I haven't even started, I believe that there is no way to teach how to write fiction.

This may be the inappropriate to say on a creative writing workshop platform, but it’s true. Everything can be learned from Brother's Karamazov for everything is in Brother's Karamazov.

Besides, writing is born from writing. From digesting it. Creating it. Swirling around what has been said by trying to say it first, then finding one’s own way say something else later on. It is an experiment in tying uncommon events together, avoiding worn, old phrases like square pegs and round holes, and then creating a square peg that fits into a round hole. It is walking around a city, observing all that is and all that isn’t and wondering why one exists over the other.  It is scribbling an answer on toilet paper even if the urgency of bowels demand otherwise. It is the waddle afterwards. It is understanding how social norms dichotomize and separate, how orders of truth exist, and how all things are either forms of political rebellion or acquiescence. It is reading. And reading. And reading. It is sitting down and spewing words one after another like metastatic tumor tumbling first from the head then trickling out to the spine in back pains and an arched decay, slowly spreading towards bent fingers, each letter agonizingly following the other until there is a sentence, then a second, then a third. It is being able to erase all three, then dying again with the fresh page. It is living to write another too.

To write fiction, then, one must write fiction. There is no shortcut, no how-to. There is only you, a desk, and a page. Luckily, this is all that you need.

I think back to that ether, to the vitamin E. Small, understandable steps generated the compound. Steps that are generalizable, repeatable. And as a result, the molecule is hitchhiking around in your body, removing free radicals and forming red blood cells.

It is in me too, a person altogether different from you but constituted similarly. We have unique experiences, unique stories. But we tell them the same way - through these words and throughout their use. For me, that means knowing I am a failed chemist, a failed teacher, and maybe a failed writer too (“to write fiction, then, one must write fiction” - not about it). You? I don’t know. Only you do, and no one can write a story like you.

This site helps to get the most out of you. The other two aspects – the desk and page – are left to carpenters and paper makers. You, on the other hand, are a chemistry experiment gone right. You are part of the chemical Universe chemically parting with the universes around you: you are writing.

As Muriel Rukeyser said, 'The Universe is made of stories, not atoms.'

The workshop here will assist in finding these stories, will show the shared processes that tie us, and will help you compose ether from nothing. It will allow you to see the collisions between unlikely events and to understand what’s going on in the beaker you find yourself in. And it will lead you to understand that for every action and reaction, there is a story in between. Vitamin E is the proof.

title: "Elements",
teaser: "The Atoms of Fiction",
body: "Roadkill Pie

I can’t cook. The majority of my dishes share a likeness with roadkill. Sometimes, maggots would be a welcome addition.

But I understand cooking, or at least the principle behind it. Add a bit of this. A pinch of that. Sniff. A dollop more. Squish squish. Mix. A cake. Or a pie. Or something good, something edible, something worth the effort and ingredients which may very well be fine by themselves: an apple pie.

Carl Sagan said, “To make an apple pie, first you need to create the Universe.” The same is true of stories. To create a fictional apple pie, one must first know its Universe. As Edgar Roberts and Henry Jacobs said, “In good writing, detailsa re used only as evidence in an original pattern of thought.”

To that end, a few constituent elements are inevitable in fiction: setting, character, and plot. While these are elementary, known by anyone ever, they are essential to play with. Whereas most mention them as constraints and limitations, they are hardly as such. Even before defining them, it must be mentioned that setting may fall within a character. Microbes could be gallivanting on a protagonist’s body. Time, with its seeming inextrictability in setting, may be a plot device, as in Slaughterhouse V. Nothing is mandatory. Nothing is required. All that is necessary is if it works, it works totally.

To this end, what is vital to ask and avoid are, as George Orwell stated, “dying metaphors, operators or verbal false limbs, pretentious diction, meaningless words.” Additionally, a writer must always ask (assuming we avoid the lack of gender differentiation, which I’m sure he’d have to see if he followed his own instruction), “in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?”

Setting

Setting is the where and how and when. It has multiple uses – credibility (lends realism by making the scenery more detailed), character (contextualize a character’s actions i.e. a drunk in a bar), organization (structure the narrative), statement (define the language of the author), atmosphere (provide a tone consistent throughout the story), irony (surprise the reader with their prejudices for events in peculiar locations i.e. murder on a beautiful summer’s day). Hardly is it ever static, even in a single location. In Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery, for example, setting is described differently by different characters. Some see just a bank. Others see a fruitful park. Others, it could be say, see nothing at all.

Hemingway is a good case study for further elaboration as he used place as the unit to propel his stories.

Hemingway's Place

Hemingway - “If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them” [1]

Hemingway – “Let’s say that he should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life. At least he will have the story of the hanging to commence with.” [2]

There is an irony in discussing Ernest Hemingway’s craftsmanship. Though an apt conversationalist and a sensitive narrator, he considered it inappropriate for a writer to discuss writing, as though in doing so removes “whatever butterflies move their wings and the arrangements of hawk feathers.” [3] This is not because he has a narrow range of forms or techniques available to him, but rather that writing is a lonely work done by lonely people and it is this loneliness where fiction can be debated, experimented with, and discussed. Hemingway himself went so far to profess, “In truly good writing no matter how many times you read it, you don’t know how it is done.” [4]

But his texts, and the exactness he demonstrates within them, leave clues. Among the many is that a writer should begin as close to the end, provide as much detail in as little words as possible, not copy what has already been done satisfactorily, or at the very least, beat the dead men and women who have done so, convey the experience as it is, not as it could be, and know everything required for a story, and then realizing that even that may not be enough.

Most of these lessons were contrary to the culture from which they came. While little can be gleaned by comparing literature to its historical circumstances, the popular writers of Hemingway’s time – writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, D. H Lawrence, Gustav Flaubert – seem, as Paris Interview stated, “to have been denationalized in quality and type.” [5] Their sense of the world, while uniquely dictated and elaborated on, point towards the modern feeling of globalization. The local and provincial are lost in an ever-expanding, ever-changing world.

Hemingway was, and is, different. The core of his writing captures a place in its most immediate, most personal way. Land is not seen as something fleeting or just an area to reside in; the cultural history, the emotional significance, the deep regional traditions are defined, understood, and utilized throughout his stories.

Location, then, becomes the unit from which he operates. It defines all the action, as well as the meaning behind it. It rounds off character’s intentions (though Hemingway would remind that he only creates “real people. Characters are caricatures”) [6] and it sets the mood within his works. Without background, there is only emptiness and random splatters that never quite fill the page.

Consider a passage in The Sun Also Rises:

“When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.” [7]

Or one in the short story Up in Michigan:

“Hortons Bay, the town, was only five houses on the main road between Boyne City and Charlevoix. There was the general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front, Smith’s house, Stroud’s house, Dillworth’s house, Horton’s house and Van Hoosen’s house. The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the road was very sandy. There was farming country and timber each way up the road. Up the road a ways was the Methodist church and down the road the other direction was the township school. The blacksmith shop was painted red and faced the school.” [8]

In both the instruments at work are the sense of place, of fact, and of time. Hemingway goes through each tool individually and frame by frame. In The Sun Also Rises, the chaos is shown rather than described. The place is first seen from above, almost like as if by a god  – it is an empty town with narrow streets. Then the anticipation is felt: “all the balconies were crowded with people.” Then the quiet is broken by the sounds of human running, some moving faster, some slower than others. The bulls follow behind with a “bare” margin of error. All these events are situated in Pamplona. The cultural implication, emotional import, and social customs of the bull running anchors itself in this place, and the narrator awakens both figuratively and literally to this meaning through the terrain itself.

In Up in Michigan, a similar effect is at work. Like a video camera panning over scenery, Hemingway crafts the place with slow care. The crevices of Hortons Bay are known as though it has always been known. The details of the town are common, almost familiar: “A general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front” – all of it is depicted from the intimate perspective of someone who has seen everything in the town, from war, peace, heartache, love, vice, virtue, meaning, and absurdity.

These simple observations indicate a consciousness behind the emotion of unnoticed. Asyndeton heightens the visceral feeling while juxtaposition of sentences reduces the energy of isolated elements. If punctuated with periods and commas, the potential of each part is small by and of itself, but once put together, once placed as though a solitary breath, the text lives.

While there is certainly artifice in what is observed and what isn’t, Hemingway’s attachment to a piece of geography is part of a broader goal. Communicating in small details is meant to reflect life truthfully. For Hemingway, this means, “writing the truest sentence he knows.” [9] To do this, he writes not writing as a writer does, but as a man whose skill was laboriously earned, whose truth is never simple as it seems on the page, and who is touched by humanity, not simply because he is part of it, but because he can choose not to be, yet doesn’t – at least for the majority of his life.

This truer-than-truth-itself worldview brings with it a reality realer-than-real for the reader. Hemingway stressed that, “[the story] will become part of the reader’s experience and part of his memory. There must be things that he did not notice when he read the story or the novel which without his knowing it, that enter into his memory and experience so that they are part of his life.” [10] To achieve this connection, he creates a depiction of life without the excess in scrutiny or wild fantasies of emotion, thought, or ideas. There is no abstraction; things are described as they are for there is no other way to describe them. They come as if spoken or transcribed from the world – sometimes tattered, sometimes unfinished, sometimes worn. Words are repeated. Prepositional phrases pop up indiscriminately. And while his pieces are all made up, they are made in such a way that if not true in the most present sense, then the scene seems that it will be true in some distant future.

Exercises:

1. Try to describe the room you're currently in. Do so in stages: 1) One page of rich description, being as florid as possible. Do not skimp on adjectives or details. Call a couch a red velvet, arm-pit hair dripping smell receptor. It's an ugly description, downright heinous. But try. The walls. The chair. Yourself looking on it all. You are a statue among the scene. 2) Minimalism. Call a couch a couch. A wall a wall. Say there was a room and maybe that's enough for a room implies four walls and maybe furniture. Try to focus description to its core, where meaning converges with emotion and rational structure. 3) By not mentioning the surrounding atmosphere, smell, sounds, and objects but instead their interactions with you as a being are. What does the wall mean to you? Maybe nothing. Jean Paul Sartre wrote an entire story about a wall - granted, it was an firing barrage's block. But perhaps the colour, the height, the dimensions of the wall suggest something, trigger some inner dialogue or emotion. Dig it up. Write it down. Or look at the blank page as the blank wall and realize that you wish to fill the both with something. Pictures, whether verbal or otherwise, would suffice.

2. Imagine the happiest day of your life. Where did it occur? When was it? Set the scenery by allowing the metaphorical bent of experience be situated in the place, wherever it is. This allows an understanding of the selection bias of your experience, the particular details you focused on as they contributed to the event. Try writing from someone else's perspective. Maybe some person experiencing said event alongside you. A father. A mother. A parent figure. Whatever. But notice the nuance in what they see as a product of their experience. Note how setting changes not simply because of colour blindness, though this may be the case, but because a car to a give year old may prove more exciting than it does for a forty year old. Or one who has had an accident. Or a first time driver. Then try writing from a complete outsider perspective. This could be from an objective, omniscient creator who states the facts (while realizing that there is hardly ever such a thing). It could be from a cynic who only sees the negative in everything, including your short, never-lived again happiness. How sad.

3. A building's function often changes. What is shared, however, is the ends of housing. People are housed. Objects too. Try to imagine a building - perhaps the one you are in now. What purposes has it served? Describe them. Note that the objects within serve the ends it achieves. 

Character

It is almost insulting to refer to fictional individuals are characters. Hemingway, fitting given above, said it well, “A writer should create living people; people, not characters. A character is a caricature.”

This personalization makes sense. They have names, secrets only the reader, the writer, and the character’s are privy to. Characters become more real than people for their thoughts are known, displayed. They do not judge us. They maintain a distance, yet we come to love and hate them, to cheer them on and disparage their faults, their idiosyncrasies and their insecurities. Can’t they be different, we ask? We read on to find out.

The concept of characterization is understood for one is their own character. Sometimes, you – just like I – are protagonists. Sometimes we feel like secondary agents, people unable to get out of bed and who wait for their call, for the moment they have to show up. Nothing sooner, at least until noon.

In both instances, though, a good writer is able to reveal only what is allowed. They make readers care about characters, providing strong personal traits that embody their actions – as in The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk where Captian Queeg is chained to his small, anxiety-mitigating metal balls. Such traits further work to place readers on one moral compass or another, which mentions nothing of symbolism with Zen practice. The balls suggest moral calmness as something good in the world. In other stories, the reverse may be true. A character’s values and ideas of right and wrong can be warped. Villains are heroes; heroes, villains. Both are true.

Growth is necessary. The consequences of growth must be displayed too. In this way, each story is a bildungsroman. Each is a coming of age – or perhaps just page.

To instill this disbelief, as well as belief in the agents, one must avoid common tropes and molds. Instead, as Josip Novakovich says, “Draw portraits.” He uses the examples of misers. “Draw portraits of misers, but not as misers – as people who happen to be miserly. And if while you draw misers as people you feel that you fail to make characters but do make people, all the better.”

When creating characters, then, all must be known. Marcel Proust’s questionnaire below serves well to complete an understanding of ones’ protagonists:

What do you consider your greatest achievement?
What is your idea of perfect happiness?
What is your current state of mind?
What is your favorite occupation?
What is your most treasured possession?
What or who is the greatest love of your life?
What is your favorite journey?
What is your most marked characteristic?
When and where were you the happiest?
What is it that you most dislike?
What is your greatest fear?
What is your greatest extravagance?
Which living person do you most despise?
What is your greatest regret?
Which talent would you most like to have?
Where would you like to live?
What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?
What is the quality you most like in a man?
What is the quality you most like in a woman?
What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
What is the trait you most deplore in others?
What do you most value in your friends?
Who is your favorite hero of fiction?
Whose are your heroes in real life?
Which living person do you most admire?
What do you consider the most overrated virtue?
On what occasions do you lie?
Which words or phrases do you most overuse?
If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?
What are your favorite names?
How would you like to die?
If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?
What is your motto?
Plot

E.M Forster in Aspects of the Novel summarizes plot better than anyone. Narration, he suggests, is different than a tying of causal factors. He suggests that the following “the king died, and then the queen died” is sequence, nothing more than chronology. Plot is a capitalization of human ambition and motivation. It is action as a result of something. Forster suggest that “the king died, and then the queen died of grief” is an illustration of minimum plot. One leads to another. The operative element ‘of grief’ generates a response.

For every action, there is an equal and opposite story. It’s Newtonian. In storytelling, however, they must be coupled. The description comes in between one event to another.

Often, plot as causation takes on some aspiration. 'Man is his desire,' said Aristotle. In this want, conflict results. Typically, it can be an individual against self, nature, society, machine, god, everybody or god against everyone.

Most stories take on a structure, then. Some standardization of form. The common story arch of building, climax, and resolution is conventionally true, but there are others. Sometimes, there are none. Vladimir Nabakov’s lecture on Anton Chekov’s story, “The Lady with the Pet Dog” serves as proof.

“All the traditional rules of storytelling have been broken in this wonderful story of twenty pages or so. There is no problem, no regular climax, no point at the end. And it is one of the greatest stories ever written...

“First, the story is told in the most natural way possible…in the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice.

“Second: exact and rich characterization is attained by a careful selection and careful distribution of minute but striking features, with perfect contempt for the sustained description, repetition, and strong emphasis of ordinary authors. In this or that description one details is chosen to illuminate the whole setting.

“Third: there is no special moral to be drawn and no special message to be received.

“Fourth: The story is based on a system of waves, on the shades of this or that mood… In Chekov, we get a world of waves instead of particles of matter…

“Sixth: The story does nto really end, for as long as people are alive, there is no possible and definite conclusion to their troubles or hopes or dreams.

“Seventh: The story teller seems to keep going out of his way to allude to trifles, every one of which in another type of story would mean a signpost denoting a turn of action… but just because these trifles are meaningless, they are all-important in giving the real atmosphere of this particular story.”

title: "Criticism",
teaser: "CONSTITUTIONAL ISOMERS DRAWN OUT",
body: "The Rule

William Somerset Maugham, “There are three rules for writing... Unfortunately no one knows what they are.” [1]

William Saroyan, “Do not pay attention to the rules other people make… they make them for their own protection, and to hell with them.” [2]

If there’s one rule of fiction it is that there are no rules of fiction.

It’s almost incomprehensible to say as much. Each year people with big named degrees and small named titles – “Fiction retold”, “The Story of Fiction”, “Fiction’s Fiction” - produce a religion of beatitudes on the debate of craft. They dash away commas, rip away adjectives, and suggest one should sooner crunch on cannibalism than commit parallelism. Cromagnon grunts are better substitutes, it is said.

Famous writers aren’t exempt from the diatribe. Many prosteltize. Blessed are the one’s who never start with weather, says Elmore Leonard. Blessed are those whose characters are galleyslaves, says Vladimir Nabakov. They give-in to publishing demands, write writing about writing, and somewhere in between when they forget they are aiding their competition and their own prose changes as they age, they suggest that the divine, not the devil, are in the details so here is a detailed way to write that novel or series.

But all of these – a few commonly quoted rules of writing are noted at the bottom of this page – are exercises in literary masturbation. They are personal preferences masquerading as absolutes in tight leather and chains. Especially chains. They shackle an individual before one can form their own opinion, or better yet, write it. An example: saying that if there’s one rule of fiction it is that there are no rules of fiction.

Of course people can suckle something out of the constitutions of storytelling in very much the same way a person can believe a rock as a pet. But both are lifeless testaments to how lonely people tend to be – imaginative constructions comfort us. 

The History

Much of this trend towards standardization of craft is born from an industrizalization of writing where MFAs are manufactured and shuttled out as any fine chair or table. Current projections put MFAs graduation at around 15,000 annually, which is only projected to slug its way up and up. And with costs around $100,000 US annually, it may seem that the MFAs the analogy was incongruent: MFAs are finer than factory-made chairs. And probably less profitable too, at least for the graduate.

It wasn’t always this way. Fiction is rooted in what Jonathan Gottschall calls, “the story-telling DNA.” Since primitive civilizations, anecdotes, folk tales, and myths have echoed in the language, in us. More than just a necessary evolutionary psychological phenomena that ensures survival among humans, story telling is an innate disposition; we wish to understand who we are. Listening to a story allows us to quell, or at the very least understand, this existential dread by experiencing it vicariously through others. From the product of one’s imagination, lessons can be learned, and fiction in particular can shape one’s beliefs, behaviour, and ethics. People can hope, despair, condemn and condone without all the messy after-effects and risks. With neural pathways firing away, an entire cultural history can be defined, captured, and reinvented in one story.

This inclination to both show and tell has taken many forms. Spanish and Italian novels like Miguel Cervantes Don Quixote separated away from the classical and religious fanatism of the medieval ethos. Romanticism shifted towards a luxury of language. Sprawling scenes, florid descrptions, uncovering of intricacies in characters and plot drenched the pages. American formalism cut the field. Edgar Allen Poe’s invention of the short story focused the “worldly interests” that novels scattered about with into a “totality” of comprehension, rigor, and emotion. The result became a concentrated tale that imprinted a single message.

All of these, as David Lodge notes, “have roots in modern poetics, which itself grew out of the poetical revolutions of symbolism.” While poetry may differ from prose in multiple ways, the suggestions are the same: writing is coupled to geographical and historical processes, embodying the letters, philosophy, and individual changes in the microcosm of a work. Reject or accept, elaborate or remain mute, the writer is the distillate of the world around them. This is to suggest that books, and the stories within them, represent the cultures in which they are printed. They bubble the human experience. Texts serve the servers, the texters (in both the modern and literal sense of the word) that create the texts. 

Current tradition centers around American formalism. 

The Good Story

Vladimir Nabakov, “It’s a short walk from hallelujah to the hoot.” [3]

Ernest Hemingway, “The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in shock-proof shit-detector.” [4]

Yet what makes a good story? Is it compelling? Is it methodical? Does it convey some moral message? Are there particular artful elements? Is it funny or serious, happy or sad, a depiction of life or just the opposite?

Ambiguity abounds when trying to figure out the answer. What is good and what is bad and what is somewhere in between depends on the fashion of the time, the interpretation of an individual reader, and the author’s skill in satisfying either a reader’s expectation or their own. For some critics, this means being truer to life than life itself. Jean Paul Sartre said novelists should “exist in a matter of things, of plants, of events, and not at first like products of man.” [5] His realism requirement is extreme, where the author is a “fern in midst of a universe where there are no witnesses.” [6] Following his rubric, one cannot summarize, shorten dialogue, or magnify one a day into three paragraphs whereas a year is telescoped into a sentence. For others like George Bowering, there is need to remind the reader that fiction is illusionary. This includes involving the author intimately in the work with asides, intrusions, and points of debate, whether with one character or another. “Writing is writing – sculpture doesn’t try to pretend it’s not there. None of the other arts tries to pretend it’s not there, so why should prose?” [7] And for other’s like James Joyce, the only requirement that it be “interesting”.  

Such haze in agreement, not to mention all the varied output, between the great wordsmiths may point towards the difficulty in attempting to compartmentalize and nit-pick at a story. In their very act of composition, short stories are limited, arbitrarily selected, and in a sense, a death of a great imaginative and infinite world of possibility. Like Aristotle’s Theory of Ideal Forms, the ideal exists in this universe of pre-composition, and it is the author that moves ever further from this perfection by writing and writing and writing some more. [8] The subjects become more shut in on themselves, the literary tools become contained in the work’s own terms, and a set of experiences, conditions, and laws are confined to an author’s interpretation, rather than some universal and nebulous form. This says nothing of the differences in acceptability from person to person, land to land, time to time.

A white page, on the other hand, tells every story. In fact, all stories began must begin from this fruitful ground, and once they do, they poison the possibilities.

This, of course, is just a banal platitude by itself that says nothing at all about the criticism of fiction. But it does highlight the clash between an aesthetic ideal and the realism as explained by Sartre. Both differ in their goals, and thus, both are justified in pursuing these goals. One cannot try to layer a work written in one form over the other for they are composed differently. To compare them with some preconceived abstraction is to fail to see the noncongruency between them, in addition to committing the fallacy of undifferentiated middle. [9] One can only see how well they achieve their means according to their own philosophies. If it’s meant to serve as an objective lens of reality, then the story cannot be riddled with artifice; if pure, one must eschew the brutality of an authorial middleman altogether.

Yet no technique or quality, however apt and beautifully woven into one part of a story and however generally agreed upon in the environment of literary pluralism, is suitable for all works, even those of the same genre. This applies within the same story itself. A climax filled with asyndeton for a brief, life-like pausing effect, almost as though the narrator is inhaling and exhaling as was done in Hemingway’s The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, Edgar Allen Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart, or Kurt Vonnegut’s Guns Before Butter, may not be appropriate for an introduction, which in Hemingway’s case was a long-winded dialogue, a smorgasbord of jarring lucidity and insanity blurred in Poe, and a hilarious punch line in Vonnegut.

Thus while one critic can acclaim this or that while deploring that or this, not all can be a written on a critic’s supposed literary zenith; there must be a land upon which the highest point rests, one where each crest and each trough and each sweet middle bit is placed as needed by the author’s narrative geography.

As Wayne C. Booth reminds, “Even the greatest literature depends on impurities for its greatness and if some of the purest literature is very bad indeed, degrees of purity are useless as general criteria.” [10]

Formal Elements

Edgar Allen Poe, “A short story must have a single mood and every sentence must build towards it.” [11]

John Gardner, “Fiction is essentially a serious, beneficial, game played against chaos and death, against entropy.” [12]

In this way, stories, as G.F Fraser said, are “explorations, not expositions,” [13] where a writer arrives at life, or the lack thereof, through the story and the story alone. Though it is true that the very act of telling a story is an attempt to make stories transparent to themselves through an introduction, middle, conclusion, moral dilemmas, and manifold characters, focusing on the innate and intrinsic elements of a story tells nothing more than what one is already looking for. For example: assessing how an author uses first person is senseless unless one describes how the particular qualities of a first person narrator relate to the effect created, maintained, and imposed on a reader throughout the work.

Constituent elements in literature hardly make the whole. Just as a string is not a sweater, a hair a wig, plot, character, allusion, parallelism, foil are simply rhetoric in fiction, an inevitable aspect of a hundreds of small deliberations and planned effects. But such literary devices rarely account for the intrinsic theme and total communication developed in a work. Instead such narrow investigations only magnify the supposed and speculative ends of a particular instance, not necessarily the complete ends that are achieved.

Could one understand the quick attentiveness and wild fantasy of Don Quixote solely by looking at plot structure? Does Crime and Punishment hinge on one technique like alliteration? Perhaps. But in both accounts, and arguably in all fiction, such rhetorical tools only serve the objectives of the entire work. They build the effect, but they are not the effect itself. Rather such authorial flares, styles, and purposefully implemented intrusions are the means by which all is understood – the proverbial steps to get to another floor. And while it is important to stand comfortably on one stair before another, staying on the single step is to forget about the plateau at the end.

This does not mean formulative principles are unhelpful. Systematic elements are present in every art. Without them, no art would exist. Understanding the individual components heightens the appreciation of any work, and the criticism of fiction cannot shirk the duty of attempting to explain an author’s successes and failures by a comparison to a set of principles. What has been done has been done because it works. And one can, as Ernest Hemingway said, always “learn about writing from everybody who has ever written something that has anything to teach you.

Narration, it is thus suggested, is to be treated as an art, not a science. Though it can be put under the rigor of a methodical process by constructing a specific, limiting, and controlled hypotheses, experiments, and subsequent conclusions, it need not be limited to such cold scrutiny. Unlike science which requires the structure of nonsuperimposable paradigms, literature is not static. [14] It is dynamic and fluid, an evolution of style and authorial intent. Each work is unique, and attempting to conform a piece to some past convention is to deny the history beyond it. A writer is the sum of all that has been written before them. None is completely alone in the creative endeavor. As a result, they can use or disparage anything for their work. That is, they can playful disrespect the forms of previous traditions, techniques, and tendencies as long as doing so suits the quality of the drama intended.

Realism

Flannery O’Connor, “You can’t clobber a reader while he’s looking. You divert his attention, then clobber him and he never knows what hit him.” [15]

Andre Gide, “One of the great rules of art: do not linger.” [16]

A tale survives in the world it is constructed within. This is important to understand. Whether consciously or unconsciously, a writer must determine all of the details that otherwise describe regular life in order to create a functional, cohesive narrative, from the geography, political structure, social mores, behaviour, economical markets, religious traditions, and anatomy. Only then, once all is fleshed out, can ink people with ink worries and ink jobs and ink dogs be born from the ink itself.

This result may come naturally, a consequence of understanding one character’s actions or motives and then placing them in a scene where such desires have meaning. It can also be forced, where Nabakov said, “characters are galley slaves.” [17] Regardless of how it comes, what is required, as Henry James said, to “write decently” is to “know everything.” [18] Despite the cliché, it is not the devil, but good narration, that is situated in the details.

And to know them is to know the divine.

Complete knowledge thus allows liberties in creation. Like a god, anything is possible with omnipotence. But not all needs to occur and the Big Bang need not bang big. One can restrict stories to a very limited range, as in Alice Munro does in Southern Ontario, or they can span entire universes, as with Isaac Asimov. Which the author will choose depends on the understanding of the detail in the story. Henry Fielding, writing in Tom Jones, stated:

“My reader then is not to be surprised, if, in the course of this work, he shall find some chapters very short, and others altogether as long; some that contain only the time of a single day, and others that comprise years; in a word, if my history sometimes seems to stand still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself as accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever; for as I am, in reality, the founder of a new province of writing, so I am at liberty to make the laws I please therein.” [19]

This generation of a ‘new province’ is not a consequence of Gottschall’s perviously mentioned evolutionary psychological claim, then, but a necessary part of it. Fiction must create truth truer than truth in real life. This is no lie; otherwise the conceit of a vicariously learned lesson is lost and one cannot benefit from it in evolutionary terms. If this occurred, we would not be the story-telling animals we are today.

But it does not mean that absolute realism is required to bridge the falsity. Forgetting the fact that science fiction, fantasy, and myth exist as a contradiction to any flawless attempts at an entirely realistic rendering, literature is a necessary deceit. It is like life, but not like it all the same. It is a metaphor through and through.

Life is full of detail. It bubbles with intricacies. Most of it is overwhelming, a sea of distractions – what James Wood calls, “inevitable surplus.” [20] There is no direction, no heightening of one thing or another.

On the other hand, literature notices. It magnifies. It dramatizes everything, even the mundane, to a point of intimate significance. A necklace takes on physical weight – a character can hold it, wear it, destroy it – but it also carries a symbolic bent. It is stuck in this haze of the metaphysical – what TS. Eliot referred to as the “objective correlative” [21] – where the abstract takes on conceptions of a thing implied at the most fundamental level, the attached language of an author, the apparent linguistics of the world, the barbarianism of one character, the eloquence of another, the huffs, the puffs, and all the sounds that define the terminology and vernacular of the created universe. The necklace, then, is not actually reproduced as it may be if simply visualized in reality. It instead stimulates one’s impulses, thoughts, and memories in visually creative ways. The result is not just an object – a white necklace sitting on a desk with dust on it – but a total image that invokes feelings, cravings, and possibly even movement, whether away from or towards the necklace.

Language in fiction therefore acts as guideposts in very different ways than it does in reality. Just as a conductor’s hand directs types of music or a painter’s paint creates scenery, words allow for the medium of conversation between author and reader. One recognizes and makes sense of organized lines filled with nothing more than twenty-six symbols, ten numerals, and a dollop of punctuation. And it is with this combination on a page – a page that was once blank and lifeless – where life comes to live, even if artificially.

The Reader

Mark Harris, “I write; let the reader learn to read.” [22]

Kurt Vonnegut, “You’ve got to be a good date for the reader.” [23]

All stories are about humankind. Even those that actively eschew human characteristics – the myths, the fantastical, the sci-fi – are understood solely in human terms. Text necessitates a human reading a human’s writing, and the connection is always present whether conscious or not.
This is not to say an author is restricted to human emotions and temperament. Hardly. Great fiction moves beyond human daily existence with its opposites and truths, its happiness and its sadness mixing together so easily. It describes things that until that very moment right then as one’s eyes roll over a sentence that is flat and unmoving yet somehow still stirring around, were unnoticed but now take on new meaning.

Ronald Barthes argued this new connotation of an old thing, be it a feeling, an object, or a person, makes absolute realism impossible – it is too ingrained, too unnoticed to stir emotional consequence. “Realism is a system of conventional codes, a grammar so ubiquitous that we do not notice its structure.” [24] Thus, he suggests, fiction approaches verisimilitude, but never achieves it. An author extracts life to its essence.

But in this failure to reflect the real is the unavoidable gap of fiction – between the author and the reader. Every literary work is an extensive display of controls and filters. A reader’s involvement can be hampered or encouraged, facts can be hidden or revealed, techniques like irony offer a sense of collusion between those who understand its use and those who cannot grasp the inside joke. Whether knowingly or not, a writer alienates some readers and attracts others by the very fact that they are writing about something or someone or sometime in the first place.

Despite efforts and beliefs otherwise, then, a writer is not an all-powerful engineer. They can direct one’s imagination, but they do not determine it. The reader can only fulfill this end, and they become the criteria of which the author’s ultimate success, at least in an extended interpretation of a Gotshallean sense, is determined. If a reader doesn’t like a piece, then it has failed the reader (even if the author may have achieved their set outcome and therefore the piece is not a failure).

It bears mentioning, though, that readers differ. Entrenched in the private act, the “common reader” as Virginia Woolf stated, “differs from the critic and the scholar. He is worse educated, and nature has not gifted him so generously. He reads for his own pleasure rather than to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of others.” [25]

To minimize the dissonance between these groups, the author tampers with distance. This is done either with the narration itself or the suspension of disbelief. In terms of the former, some attempt to involve the reader thoroughly by making each word, punctuation, and space important. Others drown a text with authorial commentary, thereby making the holding the reader’s hand as they make it through a page. In terms of the latter, Northrop Frye’s ‘displacement’ is gauged. [26] What is real and what is fake and what can be a probable with either combination is balanced. Some readers will therefore allow mythos to encroach the realm of fiction whereas others will see it as an unsightly artifice.

The tightrope between the two – narration and disbelief – is thin. And both belief and disbelief must be balanced. If the writer is the under necessary distance, whatever that may be for the particular piece, the work becomes a personal anecdote that cannot fully be enjoyed as an art; if over, the piece will be implausible, insincere, and absurd.

In either approach, however, the author will, as Saul Bellow, wrote, “construct a humanity”. [27] It is to these imagined people with their collective acumen and sense of perception that the writer develops his text towards. Being unable to know whether a reader feels, sees, and understands as he or she does, the writer assumes this quality or that one, and therefore endows the reader with a minimum, as well as maximum, consciousness.

This is even true if an author writes without thinking of the audience. “Regardless of an author’s professed indifference to the reader,” Booth writes, “every book carves out from mankind those readers for which its peculiar effects were designed.”

The Author

 William Maxwell “You must be aware that the reader is at least as bright as you are.” [28]

James Wood, “A novel fails not when characters are not vivid or deep enough but when the novel in question has failed to teach us to adapt to its conventions, has failed to manage a specific hunger for own characters, its own reality level.” [29]

In the 60s, the “death of the author” was a fashionable topic among literary circles. [30] It was argued that it was language that did the real writing – conveying the emotions, passions, and desires – not the person behind the words. The liberal humanist notion of an author as the “prime mover”, to, ironically enough, use Aristotle’s language, was disregarded for a lifeless, impersonal view. [31] Style, technique, and authorial intent, it was assumed, was a mere footnote, a syntactical presence and no more.

Such a perception has not prevailed, however, partly because it stands contrary to the very act of composition one knows to be true. Behind each word, each sentence, and each paragraph is a man or woman or somewhere in between who has given the story life, who has sat down alone in a room, and bled onto a page. They are living artifacts where breaths are captured and moments of a summer’s afternoon are recorded. One cannot alienate the two.

By telling a tale, a writer becomes part of it just as much as it becomes part of them. Hemingway lingers in between the bare, naked spaces of his prose. We see him, his torment, and his eventual suicide reflected in his lack of description, his macho subject matter, and his sparse adjective use. Vonnegut bumbles around with a whoopee cushion, where the characters he imagines are just as bitched as he was. Everything from the plots to the allusions to the vulnerabilities acts as Vonnegut does when faced with injustice: using simple beauty and laughter as a self-defense against a cruel and unfair world.

Without understanding the connection of particular material to the living author, the sense of the tale is only partial. Yet this implies that there can be a secondary interpretation of a text beyond personal detail; that is, of an author different from the one who is actually doing the writing. While both influence one another, it is the implied author of the text who determines how a story is dictated, whether unreliably or reliably.

Booth calls this the “implied author”. [32] This constructed narrator defines the involvement and detachment of a reader. Everything from the setting, the timeline, a character’s thoughts, an elaboration of an event, the meaning behind a symbol, the societal hierarchies, the economic tendencies, who is a good parent, who is a bad one, people’s relations to one another, the number of fast-food joints in a town – all of it is either withheld or elaborated on by the fabricated author of the tale. They define its limits, its laws, and its morals, and these may have widely differ from the actual author’s personal lived experiences.

Of course, the basics in storytelling remain the same between these two possible narrators – the personal and the imagined. There are still central characters. There are still conflicts. There is still opposition. And there is still a conclusion where the character, a group of them, or everyone in the world wins, loses, or draws.

What differs in the implied author is their relation to the reader. It must be remembered that the reader is invented as well. As a result, only when these two imagined means align is there complete agreement between what is said and what is understood. Anything else is ragged disharmony.

A writer cannot predict how best to achieve this congruency. Instead, all the constructions must point towards some action, some mood, or some tone. James Joyce implicitly referred to this all-encompassing drive forward as a “lucid reflector” [33] whereas James Wood called it “thisness”. [34] One needs to know enough for maximum dramatic effect without killing it with palpability. To do this in a short story, there must be movement – quickly and without hesitance in just the first few sentences – and a reader must understand that they are reading. They must feel a book in their hand. They must have their fingertips tickled by the edges of the paper. And they must forget this altogether.

The only way this is achievable is by understanding the goals of a piece. Under a verbal microscope, each word must fit with the other, each clause must relate to the whole, and each paragraph must be meaningful not because simply they have been written, but because there was no other way to write it in the first place.

All must function together in the functioning world of the story. If this were not the case, and one little moment, however insignificant or grand, was out of place – which very well may have happened in some short stories below – then the story not only fails in its Woodean purpose. It just flat out fails.

body: "Workshopping Workshops

This workshop is not what I wanted it to be. It is not what it should be either. It is a failure squished out of a failure – me.

I did not want it to be dripping disappointment, sprawling half-truths and inconsistencies. Nor did I wish for limbless modifiers that dangle, torn and ripped from the paragraph that holds them. Other expectations existed. Large monoliths of craft would be erected. Dictionaries would consult me for my originality and verbalization of current unspeakable feelings and ideas. The prefect sentence would be written that could sum up an entire universe of composition, and it would be quoted again and again and again. Nothing else could be said.

This is what is left. This is what remains. The in between. Not the workshop I outlined. Not the one I imagined. Just what happened, what resulted from sitting in front of my computer, thinking, wondering, and eventually writing something that would make me think and wonder some more. Something like this, but not like it either.

These failures of personality and capacity may seem too private, too intricate within the core of Kacper. They may not matter, which makes them all the more burrowed in self-doubt, vulnerability, and insecurity. It’s a cycle - myopia, then compromisation, then blurring hands in front of my face, away from the keyboard. I do not write. I stagnant. I listen. I hear: “This isn’t good.” And the voice is right. “Workshop is a grand term for a turd.” And it is right again. “Do you really think anyone will read this? Will you?” And it, whoever it is, waits for me to respond, watching me as I creep over my last sentence, erase it, rewrite it, and then leave it as is and as it isn’t too. As it could be.

This is literature – a testament to what if but also what is. This. Nothing more but at least nothing less.

Failure is integral to prose. Without it, there is no story. Characters have foibles. Nonheros exist. Conflicts arise from trite concerns. Imaginary ones too, usually.

But writing is an inchoate process. So is the product. This. Nothing more but at least nothing else.

It could be more. It always could be more. I could rewrite and rewrite and rewrite in that order, trying to capture fleeting ideas, compelling sentences vague notions of being – whether my own or the people in my stories. I could spend hours on comma splices, looking up the rules and regulations, ensuring complete comprehension and that sentences end when they are supposed to as opposed to running on about nothing at all, just feelings or something like them, something not described because to write it down would mean to give it existence and there is none, at least none known, but it is there, here, always. Then I could discover that periods were needed, not commas. That all I’ve said has been phrased more eloquently and succinctly. That I struggled irredeemably. And that anything I type can be summed up in three words: is this it?

There’d be no answer because I wouldn’t know one. I didn’t know what else to blab away about. All I has was this. Nothing more but at least nothing else.

Failing Failure

I’m sure some may believe otherwise, pointing to one instance where a sentence impacted them like a snowball on a summer’s day – unexpected but refreshing with the hope that another may come with all the originality and immediacy of the first. They may suggest I’m being too hard. Or that I failed at failing. I, as Samuel Beckett said, “failed better.”

This is false. I am not good enough. Don’t worry – this isn’t self-deprecation. You aren’t either. We’re shits. Smelly products of digestion from influences and consumption. Writing is no different. It is a smudge pretending to be a fine line. Looking from afar, it is just dense text. Up close it may very well be the same.

James Joyce called piers “disappointed bridges”, and the same can be said of any composition. Novels are bloated short stories, short stories are fluffs of sentences. All are starving for substance. All are starving for something else than what they are.

Zadie Smith suggested that, “Map of disappointments … is a suitable guide to the land where writers live, a country I imagine as mostly beach, with hopeful writers standing on the shoreline while their perfect novels pile up, over on the opposite coast, out of reach. Thrusting out of the shoreline are hundreds of piers, or 'disappointed bridges', as Joyce called them. Most writers, most of the time, get wet.”

Understanding this inevitable, innate, unbearable loss is necessary to understand how to write fiction. One can have craft, can comprehend and expertly tout one rule or another (for example: not to use adjectives like expertly). But this will leave a taxidermists wetdream – anatomically correct stuffing. There will be no core, no beat, no rhythm of this – nothing more but at least nothing less.

What does it mean to ingest failure? Social innovation, a mickey-mouse field that any sensible grammarian would mumble away as a functionless euphemism, has some clues. It suggests, “failing big, fast, hard, and again.” While this may seem a prepubescent boy’s wishful motto, it holds some truth. Particularly, the again is necessary to write. One must get it right, reread, and get it right using different words, the right ones, the real right ones, this time. One must also realize that the right ones may never come, and they must move on to the next paragraph.

Sometimes, the next paragraph will be worse even if it is smaller and less has happened. It is a starved, depraved thing.

The third is no better.

And so on.

In this endless loop is the secret to succeeding in writing – not succeeding. To succeed in some ostensible sense is a myth, an impossibility. Readers will draw what they will, based on their day or month. Critics will blather on about the cliches and flock of misquotations. Mothers will disapprove generally.

This is okay. This is okay. In fact, this is perfect. This is your ideal work. This is all it can be – this. Nothing more but at least nothing less.

You

E.B. White is in the above banner image. In it, he only has a typewriter, a desk, and himself. He does not know you are looking at him. He can't. He is dead. All that is leftover is this picture and the words he used. Whether they were the ones he imagined are an altogether different matter.

What is important to note, however, is that he wrote what he knew. He wrote about himself and his experiences and a literate spider. You, on the other hand, could write about an illiterate spider. It would be like most spiders, I suppose, but it'd be yours. You'd give it life, even if you don't like spiders. This is important. Don't be afraid. It is your pet. Grow it. Nurture it. Feed it your blood and words.

If not, you are an equally interesting subject. You can play with your life, changing one thing or another. Maybe you identify as a boy. Don't for a moment. See that? Feel it? No? Try again. Can't? Good. You are failing. Again. 

Write about being a girl imagining yourself in your earliest memory and then when you were seven. What are you doing? What are you wearing? What do you want to wear? A dress of spider's silk? A dress of silky spiders? Have you at your earliest, all gurgly and blubbery, and have a conversation with your now seven-year-old girl self. Maybe over tea, though that'd be stereotypical and unoriginal. Maybe it's still nonetheless true. I don't know. You do. Let us find out."
