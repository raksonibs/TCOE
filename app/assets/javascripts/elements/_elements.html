        Elements <small> The Atoms of Fiction</small>
        </h2>
        <h3 class="post-subtitle">
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>RoadKill Pie</b></span><br>
          I can’t cook. The majority of my dishes share a likeness with roadkill. Sometimes, maggots would be a welcome addition. <br><br>
          But I understand cooking, or at least the principle behind it. Add a bit of this. A pinch of that. Sniff. A dollop more. Squish squish. Mix. A cake. Or a pie. Or something good, something edible, something worth the effort and ingredients which may very well be fine by themselves: an apple pie. <br><br>
          Carl Sagan said, “To make an apple pie, first you need to create the Universe.” The same is true of stories. To create a fictional apple pie, one must first know its Universe. As Edgar Roberts and Henry Jacobs said, “In good writing, detailsa re used only as evidence in an original pattern of thought.”<br><br>
          To that end, a few constituent elements are inevitable in fiction: setting, character, and plot. While these are elementary, known by anyone ever, they are essential to play with. Whereas most mention them as constraints and limitations, they are hardly as such. Even before defining them, it must be mentioned that setting may fall within a character. Microbes could be gallivanting on a protagonist’s body. Time, with its seeming inextrictability in setting, may be a plot device, as in Slaughterhouse V. Nothing is mandatory. Nothing is required. All that is necessary is if it works, it works totally.<br><br>
          To this end, what is vital to ask and avoid are, as George Orwell stated, “dying metaphors, operators or verbal false limbs, pretentious diction, meaningless words.” Additionally, a writer must always ask (assuming we avoid the lack of gender differentiation, which I’m sure he’d have to see if he followed his own instruction), “in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?” <br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Setting</b></span><br>
         Setting is the where and how and when. It has multiple uses – credibility (lends realism by making the scenery more detailed), character (contextualize a character’s actions i.e. a drunk in a bar), organization (structure the narrative), statement (define the language of the author), atmosphere (provide a tone consistent throughout the story), irony (surprise the reader with their prejudices for events in peculiar locations i.e. murder on a beautiful summer’s day). Hardly is it ever static, even in a single location. In Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery, for example, setting is described differently by different characters. Some see just a bank. Others see a fruitful park. Others, it could be say, see nothing at all.<br><br>
          Hemingway is a good case study for further elaboration as he used place as the unit to propel his stories.<br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Hemingway's Place</b></span><br>
          Hemingway - “If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them”<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a><br><br>
          Hemingway – “Let’s say that he should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life. At least he will have the story of the hanging to commence with.”<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> <br><br>
          TThere is an irony in discussing Ernest Hemingway’s craftsmanship. Though an apt conversationalist and a sensitive narrator, he considered it inappropriate for a writer to discuss writing, as though in doing so removes “whatever butterflies move their wings and the arrangements of hawk feathers.” <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> This is not because he has a narrow range of forms or techniques available to him, but rather that writing is a lonely work done by lonely people and it is this loneliness where fiction can be debated, experimented with, and discussed. Hemingway himself went so far to profess, “In truly good writing no matter how many times you read it, you don’t know how it is done.” <a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a><br><br>
          But his texts, and the exactness he demonstrates within them, leave clues. Among the many is that a writer should begin as close to the end, provide as much detail in as little words as possible, not copy what has already been done satisfactorily, or at the very least, beat the dead men and women who have done so, convey the experience as it is, not as it could be, and know everything required for a story, and then realizing that even that may not be enough.<br><br>
          Most of these lessons were contrary to the culture from which they came. While little can be gleaned by comparing literature to its historical circumstances, the popular writers of Hemingway’s time – writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, D. H Lawrence, Gustav Flaubert – seem, as Paris Interview stated, “to have been denationalized in quality and type.” <a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> Their sense of the world, while uniquely dictated and elaborated on, point towards the modern feeling of globalization. The local and provincial are lost in an ever-expanding, ever-changing world.<br><br>
          Hemingway was, and is, different. The core of his writing captures a place in its most immediate, most personal way. Land is not seen as something fleeting or just an area to reside in; the cultural history, the emotional significance, the deep regional traditions are defined, understood, and utilized throughout his stories.<br><br>
          Location, then, becomes the unit from which he operates. It defines all the action, as well as the meaning behind it. It rounds off character’s intentions (though Hemingway would remind that he only creates “real people. Characters are caricatures”) <a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a> and it sets the mood within his works. Without background, there is only emptiness and random splatters that never quite fill the page.<br><br>
          Consider a passage in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>:<br><br>
          <em>“When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.”</em><<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
          Or one in the short story <em>Up in Michigan</em>:<br><br>
          <em>“Hortons Bay, the town, was only five houses on the main road between Boyne City and Charlevoix. There was the general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front, Smith’s house, Stroud’s house, Dillworth’s house, Horton’s house and Van Hoosen’s house. The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the road was very sandy. There was farming country and timber each way up the road. Up the road a ways was the Methodist church and down the road the other direction was the township school. The blacksmith shop was painted red and faced the school.”</em><<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
          In both the instruments at work are the sense of place, of fact, and of time. Hemingway goes through each tool individually and frame by frame. In The Sun Also Rises, the chaos is shown rather than described. The place is first seen from above, almost like as if by a god  – it is an empty town with narrow streets. Then the anticipation is felt: “all the balconies were crowded with people.” Then the quiet is broken by the sounds of human running, some moving faster, some slower than others. The bulls follow behind with a “bare” margin of error. All these events are situated in Pamplona. The cultural implication, emotional import, and social customs of the bull running anchors itself in this place, and the narrator awakens both figuratively and literally to this meaning through the terrain itself.<br><br>
          In Up in Michigan, a similar effect is at work. Like a video camera panning over scenery, Hemingway crafts the place with slow care. The crevices of Hortons Bay are known as though it has always been known. The details of the town are common, almost familiar: “A general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front” – all of it is depicted from the intimate perspective of someone who has seen everything in the town, from war, peace, heartache, love, vice, virtue, meaning, and absurdity.<br><br>
          These simple observations indicate a consciousness behind the emotion of unnoticed. Asyndeton heightens the visceral feeling while juxtaposition of sentences reduces the energy of isolated elements. If punctuated with periods and commas, the potential of each part is small by and of itself, but once put together, once placed as though a solitary breath, the text lives.<br><br>
          While there is certainly artifice in what is observed and what isn’t, Hemingway’s attachment to a piece of geography is part of a broader goal. Communicating in small details is meant to reflect life truthfully. For Hemingway, this means, “writing the truest sentence he knows.” <a href="#footnote-9" title="">[9]</a> To do this, he writes not writing as a writer does, but as a man whose skill was laboriously earned, whose truth is never simple as it seems on the page, and who is touched by humanity, not simply because he is part of it, but because he can choose not to be, yet doesn’t – at least for the majority of his life.<br><br>
          This truer-than-truth-itself worldview brings with it a reality realer-than-real for the reader. Hemingway stressed that, “[the story] will become part of the reader’s experience and part of his memory. There must be things that he did not notice when he read the story or the novel which without his knowing it, that enter into his memory and experience so that they are part of his life.” <a href="#footnote-10" title="">[10]</a> To achieve this connection, he creates a depiction of life without the excess in scrutiny or wild fantasies of emotion, thought, or ideas. There is no abstraction; things are described as they are for there is no other way to describe them. They come as if spoken or transcribed from the world – sometimes tattered, sometimes unfinished, sometimes worn. Words are repeated. Prepositional phrases pop up indiscriminately. And while his pieces are all made up, they are made in such a way that if not true in the most present sense, then the scene seems that it will be true in some distant future.<br><br>
          <em>Exercises:</em><br><br>
          1. Try to describe the room you're currently in. Do so in stages: 1) One page of rich description, being as florid as possible. Do not skimp on adjectives or details. Call a couch a red velvet, arm-pit hair dripping smell receptor. It's an ugly description, downright heinous. But try. The walls. The chair. Yourself looking on it all. You are a statue among the scene. 2) Minimalism. Call a couch a couch. A wall a wall. Say there was a room and maybe that's enough for a room implies four walls and maybe furniture. Try to focus description to its core, where meaning converges with emotion and rational structure. 3) By not mentioning the surrounding atmosphere, smell, sounds, and objects but instead their interactions with you as a being are. What does the wall mean to you? Maybe nothing. Jean Paul Sartre wrote an entire story about a wall - granted, it was an firing barrage's block. But perhaps the colour, the height, the dimensions of the wall suggest something, trigger some inner dialogue or emotion. Dig it up. Write it down. Or look at the blank page as the blank wall and realize that you wish to fill the both with something. Pictures, whether verbal or otherwise, would suffice.<br><br>
          2. Imagine the happiest day of your life. Where did it occur? When was it? Set thescenery by allowing the metaphorical bent of experience be situated in the place, wherever it is. This allows an understanding of the selection bias of your experience, the particular details you focused on as they contributed to the event. Try writing from someone else's perspective. Maybe some person experiencing said event alongside you. A father. A mother. A parent figure. Whatever. But notice the nuance in what they see as a product of their experience. Note how setting changes not simply because of colour blindness, though this may be the case, but because a car to a give year old may prove more exciting than it does for a forty year old. Or one who has had an accident. Or a first time driver. Then try writing from a complete outsider perspective. This could be from an objective, omniscient creator who states the facts (while realizing that there is hardly ever such a thing). It could be from a cynic who only sees the negative in everything, including your short, never-lived again happiness. How sad.<br><br>
          3. A building's function often changes. What is shared, however, is the ends of housing. People are housed. Objects too. Try to imagine a building - perhaps the one you are in now. What purposes has it served? Describe them. Note that the objects within serve the ends it achieves.<br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Character</b></span><br>
          It is almost insulting to refer to fictional individuals are characters. Hemingway, fitting given above, said it well, “A writer should create living people; people, not characters. A character is a caricature.”<br><br>
          This personalization makes sense. They have names, secrets only the reader, the writer, and the character’s are privy to. Characters become more real than people for their thoughts are known, displayed. They do not judge us. They maintain a distance, yet we come to love and hate them, to cheer them on and disparage their faults, their idiosyncrasies and their insecurities. Can’t they be different, we ask? We read on to find out.<br><br>
          The concept of characterization is understood for one is their own character. Sometimes, you – just like I – are protagonists. Sometimes we feel like secondary agents, people unable to get out of bed and who wait for their call, for the moment they have to show up. Nothing sooner, at least until noon.<br><br>
          In both instances, though, a good writer is able to reveal only what is allowed. They make readers care about characters, providing strong personal traits that embody their actions – as in The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk where Captian Queeg is chained to his small, anxiety-mitigating metal balls. Such traits further work to place readers on one moral compass or another, which mentions nothing of symbolism with Zen practice. The balls suggest moral calmness as something good in the world. In other stories, the reverse may be true. A character’s values and ideas of right and wrong can be warped. Villains are heroes; heroes, villains. Both are true.<br><br>
          Growth is necessary. The consequences of growth must be displayed too. In this way, each story is a bildungsroman. Each is a coming of age – or perhaps just page.<br><br>
          To instill this disbelief, as well as belief in the agents, one must avoid common tropes and molds. Instead, as Josip Novakovich says, “Draw portraits.” He uses the examples of misers. “Draw portraits of misers, but not as misers – as people who happen to be miserly. And if while you draw misers as people you feel that you fail to make characters but do make people, all the better.”<br><br>
          When creating characters, then, all must be known. Marcel Proust’s questionnaire below serves well to complete an understanding of ones’ protagonists:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you consider your greatest achievement?</li>
            <li>What is your idea of perfect happiness?</li>
            <li>What is your current state of mind?</li>
            <li>What is your favorite occupation?</li>
            <li>What is your most treasured possession?</li>
            <li>What or who is the greatest love of your life?</li>
            <li>What is your favorite journey?</li>
            <li>What is your most marked characteristic?</li>
            <li>When and where were you the happiest?</li>
            <li>What is it that you most dislike?</li>
            <li>What is your greatest fear?</li>
            <li>What is your greatest extravagance?</li>
            <li>Which living person do you most despise?</li>
            <li>What is your greatest regret?</li>
            <li>Which talent would you most like to have?</li>
            <li>Where would you like to live?</li>
            <li>What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?</li>
            <li>What is the quality you most like in a man?</li>
            <li>What is the quality you most like in a woman?</li>
            <li>What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?</li>
            <li>What is the trait you most deplore in others?</li>
            <li>What do you most value in your friends?</li>
            <li>Who is your favorite hero of fiction?</li>
            <li>Who are your heroes in real life?</li>
            <li>Which living person do you most admire?</li>
            <li>What do you consider the most overrated virtue?</li>
            <li>On what occasions do you lie?</li>
            <li>Which words or phrases do you most overuse?</li>
            <li>If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?</li>
            <li>What are your favorite names?</li>
            <li>How would you like to die?</li>
            <li>If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?</li>
            <li>What is your motto?</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Plot</b></span><br>
          E.M Forster in Aspects of the Novel summarizes plot better than anyone. Narration, he suggests, is different than a tying of causal factors. He suggests that the following “the king died, and then the queen died” is sequence, nothing more than chronology. Plot is a capitalization of human ambition and motivation. It is action as a result of something. Forster suggest that “the king died, and then the queen died of grief” is an illustration of minimum plot. One leads to another. The operative element ‘of grief’ generates a response.<br><br>
          For every action, there is an equal and opposite story. It’s Newtonian. In storytelling, however, they must be coupled. The description comes in between one event to another.<br><br>
          Often, plot as causation takes on some aspiration. "Man is his desire," said Aristotle. In this want, conflict results. Typically, it can be an individual against self, nature, society, machine, god, everybody or god against everyone.Most stories take on a structure, then. Some standardization of form. The common story arch of building, climax, and resolution is conventionally true, but there are others. Sometimes, there are none. Vladimir Nabakov’s lecture on Anton Chekov’s story, “The Lady with the Pet Dog” serves as proof.<br><br>
          “All the traditional rules of storytelling have been broken in this wonderful story of twenty pages or so. There is no problem, no regular climax, no point at the end. And it is one of the greatest stories ever written...<br><br>
          “First, the story is told in the most natural way possible…in the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice.<br><br>
          “Second: exact and rich characterization is attained by a careful selection andcareful distribution of minute but striking features, with perfect contempt for the sustained description, repetition, and strong emphasis of ordinary authors. In this or that description one details is chosen to illuminate the whole setting.<br><br>
          “Third: there is no special moral to be drawn and no special message to be received.<br><br>
          “Fourth: The story is based on a system of waves, on the shades of this or thatmood… In Chekov, we get a world of waves instead of particles of matter…<br><br>
          “Sixth: The story does nto really end, for as long as people are alive, there is no possible and definite conclusion to their troubles or hopes or dreams.<br><br>
          “Seventh: The story teller seems to keep going out of his way to allude to trifles, every one of which in another type of story would mean a signpost denoting a turn of action… but just because these trifles are meaningless, they are all-important in giving the real atmosphere of this particular story.”<br><br>
          <em>Exercises:</em><br><br>
          1. When were you the most afraid? Write what happened.<br><br>
          2. Imagine a cause without an effect. Something trivial, that has no response, not even a failed one. For example, read Chekov's "Lady with a Pet Dog."<br><br>
          3. Write a fight scene from the first move to the last punch.<br><br>
