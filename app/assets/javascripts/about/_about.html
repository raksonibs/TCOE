          Kacper is a twenty something year old pretending he's thirty who writes like he's fifty about things that happened when he was ten. By the time he dies, he hopes to scribble off the end of his tenth birthday. Maybe then he will also learn how to write what he wanted to say in the first place. He may have to go back, erase everything, and write this: fartnugget. It's a beautiful word, he thinks.<br><br>
         He sneezes out stories and poems at Mizpellt Wurdz, writes on a of nonfiction platforms, and has a starving selection of self-published works: Spaghetti Knots, Love you madly, Bury the Bodies Where They Lay, and The Ship Has Sailed and No One is On Board. He also flat-lines punchlines at badcomcs.ca.
