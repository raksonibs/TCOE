          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Workshopping Workshops</b></span><br>
          This workshop is not what I wanted it to be. It is not what it should be either. It is a failure squished out of a failure – me. <br><br>
          I did not want it to be dripping disappointment, sprawling half-truths and inconsistencies. Nor did I wish for limbless modifiers that dangle, torn and ripped from the paragraph that holds them. Other expectations existed. Large monoliths of craft would be erected. Dictionaries would consult me for my originality and verbalization of current unspeakable feelings and ideas. The prefect sentence would be written that could sum up an entire universe of composition, and it would be quoted again and again and again. Nothing else could be said. <br><br>
          This is what is left. This is what remains. The in between. Not the workshop I outlined. Not the one I imagined. Just what happened, what resulted from sitting in front of my computer, thinking, wondering, and eventually writing something that would make me think and wonder some more. Something like this, but not like it either.<br><br>
          These failures of personality and capacity may seem too private, too intricate within the core of Kacper. They may not matter, which makes them all the more burrowed in self-doubt, vulnerability, and insecurity. It’s a cycle - myopia, then compromisation, then blurring hands in front of my face, away from the keyboard. I do not write. I stagnant. I listen. I hear: “This isn’t good.” And the voice is right. “Workshop is a grand term for a turd.” And it is right again. “Do you really think anyone will read this? Will you?” And it, whoever it is, waits for me to respond, watching me as I creep over my last sentence, erase it, rewrite it, and then leave it as is and as it isn’t too. As it could be.<br><br>
          This is literature – a testament to what if but also what is. This. Nothing more but at least nothing less.<br><br>
         Failure is integral to prose. Without it, there is no story. Characters have foibles. Nonheros exist. Conflicts arise from trite concerns. Imaginary ones too, usually.<br><br>
          But writing is an inchoate process. So is the product. This. Nothing more but at least nothing else.<br><br>
          It could be more. It always could be more. I could rewrite and rewrite and rewrite in that order, trying to capture fleeting ideas, compelling sentences vague notions of being – whether my own or the people in my stories. I could spend hours on comma splices, looking up the rules and regulations, ensuring complete comprehension and that sentences end when they are supposed to as opposed to running on about nothing at all, just feelings or something like them, something not described because to write it down would mean to give it existence and there is none, at least none known, but it is there, here, always. Then I could discover that periods were needed, not commas. That all I’ve said has been phrased more eloquently and succinctly. That I struggled irredeemably. And that anything I type can be summed up in three words: is this it?<br><br>
          There’d be no answer because I wouldn’t know one. I didn’t know what else to blab away about. All I has was this. Nothing more but at least nothing else.<br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>Failing Failure</b></span><br>
          I’m sure some may believe otherwise, pointing to one instance where a sentence impacted them like a snowball on a summer’s day – unexpected but refreshing with the hope that another may come with all the originality and immediacy of the first. They may suggest I’m being too hard. Or that I failed at failing. I, as Samuel Beckett said, “failed better.” <br><br>
          This is false. I am not good enough. Don’t worry – this isn’t self-deprecation. You aren’t either. We’re shits. Smelly products of digestion from influences and consumption. Writing is no different. It is a smudge pretending to be a fine line. Looking from afar, it is just dense text. Up close it may very well be the same.<br><br>
          James Joyce called piers “disappointed bridges”, and the same can be said of any composition. Novels are bloated short stories, short stories are fluffs of sentences. All are starving for substance. All are starving for something else than what they are.<br><br>
          Zadie Smith suggested that, “Map of disappointments … is a suitable guide to the land where writers live, a country I imagine as mostly beach, with hopeful writers standing on the shoreline while their perfect novels pile up, over on the opposite coast, out of reach. Thrusting out of the shoreline are hundreds of piers, or "disappointed bridges", as Joyce called them. Most writers, most of the time, get wet.”<br><br>
          Understanding this inevitable, innate, unbearable loss is necessary to understand how to write fiction. One can have craft, can comprehend and expertly tout one rule or another (for example: not to use adjectives like expertly). But this will leave a taxidermists wetdream – anatomically correct stuffing. There will be no core, no beat, no rhythm of this – nothing more but at least nothing less.<br><br>
          What does it mean to ingest failure? Social innovation, a mickey-mouse field that any sensible grammarian would mumble away as a functionless euphemism, has some clues. It suggests, “failing big, fast, hard, and again.” While this may seem a prepubescent boy’s wishful motto, it holds some truth. Particularly, the again is necessary to write. One must get it right, reread, and get it right using different words, the right ones, the real right ones, this time. One must also realize that the right ones may never come, and they must move on to the next paragraph.<br><br>
         Sometimes, the next paragraph will be worse even if it is smaller and less has happened. It is a starved, depraved thing.<br><br>
          The third is no better.<br><br>
          And so on.<br><br>
          In this endless loop is the secret to succeeding in writing – not succeeding. To succeed in some ostensible sense is a myth, an impossibility. Readers will draw what they will, based on their day or month. Critics will blather on about the cliches and flock of misquotations. Mothers will disapprove generally.<br><br>
          This is okay. This is okay. In fact, this is perfect. This is your ideal work. This isall it can be – this. Nothing more but at least nothing less.<br><br>
          <span class='text-subtitle'><b>You</b></span><br>
          E.B. White is in the above banner image. In it, he only has a typewriter, a desk, and himself. He does not know you are looking at him. He can't. He is dead. All that is leftover is this picture and the words he used. Whether they were the ones he imagined are an altogether different matter.<br><br>
          What is important to note, however, is that he wrote what he knew. He wrote about himself and his experiences and a literate spider. You, on the other hand, could write about an illiterate spider. It would be like most spiders, I suppose, but it'd be yours. You'd give it life, even if you don't like spiders. This is important. Don't be afraid. It is your pet. Grow it. Nurture it. Feed it your blood and words.<br><br>
          If not, you are an equally interesting subject. You can play with your life, changing one thing or another. Maybe you identify as a boy. Don't for a moment. See that? Feel it? No? Try again. Can't? Good. You are failing. Again.<br><br>
          Write about being a girl imagining yourself in your earliest memory and then when you were seven. What are you doing? What are you wearing? What do you want to wear? A dress of spider's silk? A dress of silky spiders? Have you at your earliest, all gurgly and blubbery, and have a conversation with your now seven-year-old girl self. Maybe over tea, though that'd be stereotypical and unoriginal. Maybe it's still nonetheless true. I don't know. You do. Let us find out.<br><br>
